# Example 1: Define a function that takes an argument. Call the function. 
# Identify what code is the argument and what code is the parameter.

def breakfast(milk):
  print(breakfast + "and eggs") 
  print(breakfast + "and cookies")

breakfast()

# Breakfast is the function, milk is the parameter (as it's defined inside the function itself).
# Arguments are values you can pass to the function later. For example:



# Example 2: Call your function from Example 1 three times with different 
# kinds of arguments: a value, a variable, and an expression. Identify which kind of argument is which. 

# Example 3: Create a function with a local variable. 
# Show what happens when you try to use that variable outside the function. Explain the results.


# Example 4: Create a function that takes an argument. 
# Give the function parameter a unique name. Show what happens when you try to use that parameter name outside the function. 
# Explain the results.


# Example 5: Show what happens when a variable defined outside a function has the same name as a local variable inside a function.
# Explain what happens to the value of each variable as the program runs.
